For your written analysis, be sure to use complete and coherent sentences. Your written analysis should contain three sections, which cover the following:

1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

   The purpose of this analysis is to showcase the improvements made from the original DQ Analysis and stock analysis macro into the now refactored script that is capable of running through all the data for the stocks that are given in the worksheet. One of the key goals by doing this should be an understanding of what the improvements were, how the refactored script improves on the original script. Overall we will also be able to compare performances between both the 2017 and 2018 returns to one another so Steve can have a better idea of how to invest his parents money by assessing the options based on there Volume and Returns.

2. Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

   Execution Times (Original Script vs Refactored Script)

   The execution times during my initial testing hit a couple of snags as it took literal minutes for a code that should run in a few seconds. Once I closed any unnecessary files and windows and started running tests, it is easy to see first hand the improvement going from the original script to the refactored one brought to the table.  For example when working on my refactored code, Excel would visibly be seen looping to the corresponding workbook before popping results and sometimes even end up freezing my computer until the process was completed. With the refactored code, that is not a worry any longer, I will showcase the two below with the first image below being the original script and the second image after the refactored script.

   It is night and day a faster process that brings the results for any workbooks that have similar formatting a data for Steve to use in the future as needed and will greatly aid in generating results in a very fast and user-friendly way. It is also nice to mention that the formatting to quickly glance at which ticker index's in a glance are seeing positive or negative returns within those mere milliseconds compared to the less efficient original script. 

   Stock Performance Comparison (2017 vs. 2018)		

   When comparing these two years with one another, the differences are quite striking to one another as they are polar opposites in terms of the growth that they showcase.

   As we can see here, the performance across the board for all of these indexed stocks saw quite a bit of growth all around with TERP being the only entry that showed a negative return. As a result of this, especially when compared to what we will see in 2018, these results are much more appeasable if you are looking for positive returns that these stock options will give you in terms of the volume they accrued and the sectors of business that these stock options were aligned with. This should partially help get a good sense on whether investing in these options in the future will be a sound investment for his Steve's parents.

   As mentioned when compared to 2017, 2018's returns did not yield many positive returns which is surprising to see when looking at how successful 2017's returns ended up being. One key takeaway would be that CSIQ was the only stock option that saw returns in both 2017 and 2018 that saw positive returns which can help Steve get a better sense of which company would keep his parents money safe in the short term and the long term. Of course it would be advisable for Steve to go beyond the findings that were given in these two years and do further research to see if any trends can be spotted or good opportunities depending on his parents goals but this is a key piece of information that provides good context for his decision. 

   Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

   1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

      (Translate to Summary Statement) In summary, some advantages for refactoring code is the ability to further improve written code to optimize there key tasks, understanding whether your logic structure is sound and helps you understand why writing readable code is important. A key disadvantage would be needing to be aware whether or not code you are reapplying fits with the original code that you have kept, I ran into quite a bit of issues keeping my code consistent and cleaning up what I refactored. 

   2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

   (Translate to Summary Statement) I strongly agree with the notion that refactoring existing code gives you a good sense of the foundations of what is needed to code appropriately as I was able to see how hard to read my coding was and what to keep in mind as I practice more and more. For the key disadvantage that I wanted to highlight above, refactoring initially lead me to a dead end in terms of accomplishing the challenge's goals that were highlighted as I had issues with my code for 3 days before finding an optimized script that worked appropriately. I had to start from scratch plenty of times but I am glad I was able to complete the analysis at the end.
